DERK_ENV_DESCRIPTION = """\
The game's name is Derk, here is the description of the game Derk:
Derk is a 3 vs 3 simplified MOBA-style game. There are three players and a statue on each side. \
The goal of the game is to knock down all enemies and destroy the enemy statue. \
Each player, which is a cute dinosaur, is equipped with a pistol on arm (arm weapon) to shoot the target \
and a healing gland on the tail (tail weapon) to healing the target. \
Unlike other MOBA games such as Dota and LOL, Derk is simplified to have no item system, \
which means items and equipments the player has are fixed. There is also NO neutral creeps \
in the map, only players and their statues in the field. The home statue on each side is merely \
a statue, thus can not move, nor making damage to the enemy. There is no obstacles and terrain \
in the map, which means the battlefield is open and flat. When a player is about to do something \
on a target, it must focus on the target first, for example, when a player is going to heal a friend, \
it must focus on the friend first, then using the healing gland to heal the friend, likewise, when a \
player wants to attack an enemy, it must focus on the target enemy, then use its offensive weapon. \
Both the pistol and the healing gland has its range limits, which means when the focused target is \
out of range, trying to use a weapon will make no effects at all. Another thing to notice is that if \
the target is too close, the pistol won't shoot even the player tries to do so.\

NL_FORMAT_DESCRIPTION = f"""\
The behaviour tree and its nodes are presented in a formatted way. The explanation and format rule \
of each possible node and component is defined as follow:
\
OR node: Has one or more children, if any child returns SUCCESS, OR node returns SUCCESS, \
otherwise FAILURE.
[OR{SEP}{ID_IND}uid]{SEP}{CMT_IND} comment{SEG}\
{INDENT}children_nodes{SEG}\

otherwise SUCCESS.

\
FAILURE node: Does not have child, always returns FAILURE
[FAILURE]{SEP}{ID_IND}uid]{SEP}{CMT_IND} comment{SEG}\
\
CONDITION node: Does not have child. Return the result of a binary comparison expression. \
The binary comparison expression is composed of a left operand, a right operand, and an comparison \
operator, in the form of `left_operand operator right_operand`. Both the left and right operand can \
be attributes or methods of the agent. The right side can also be a constant, which includes \
numbers, BT_SUCCESS, or BT_FAILURE.The comparison operator can be one of the following: \
`<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`.

\
ACTION node: execute one single action, and returns SUCCESS if the action is executed, \
returns RUNNING when the action is executing. Normally, an action is a method of the agent. \
Does not have child.

SELECTOR node: Has one or more children. Tick children one by one in order, if one of the \

[END_SEL]{SEG}\
\
IFELSE node: Has exact 3 children, these are CHECK, IF and ELSE child. IFELSE node tick CHECK child first \
if CHECK child returns SUCCESS, it will tick IF child, if CHECK child returns FAILURE, it will tick ELSE \
child, if CHECK child returns RUNNING, it will tick CHECK child in the upcoming frames until CHECK child \
returns SUCCESS or FAILURE.

[END_SEQ]{SEG}\
\
NOT node: Can have ONLY ONE child, and NOT node is simply inverse the result of the child. \
If the child returns SUCCESS, NOT node returns FAILURE. If the child returns FAILURE, NOT node \
returns SUCCESS. If the child returns RUNNING, NOT node also returns RUNNING.

\
PRECONDITION attachment: is not a node, it is an attachment of a node as the node's pre-condition. \
when entering the node, if the precondition is not met, the node will not be ticked and returns \
FAILURE directly. PRECONDITION is a compound comparison expression composed of one or more binary \
comparison expressions, with logical operators connect them together. the order of evaluation of binary \
comparisons is always from left to right, for example, if we have four expressions in the order \
expr1, expr2, expr3, expr4, and three logical operators in order: `||`, `&&`, `||` to connect \
expressions together, we will always have compound condition expression: \
(((expr1 || expr2) && expr3) || expr4). the pattern remains if there are more binary comparison and \
logical operators. The rule of binary comparison expression is the same as in the CONDITION node. \
The logical operator could be `||`(or) or `&&`(and).\
Each uid in PRECONDITION attachment indicates each binary comparison in the pre-condition, \
thus the number of uid should be the same as of the binary comparisons. The node the precondition \
attached on will be declared right after the precondition declaration.

\
Here are guidelines and rules you must follow when dealing with a behaviour tree presented \
in the format mention above:
1. Children of AND node and OR node can only be SUCCESS node, FAILURE node, AND node, OR node \
and CONDITION node.
2. You should prefer to use SELECTOR node and SEQUENCE node over AND node and OR node unless you \
are pretty sure that any node under AND node and OR node are legal according to the first rule.
3. The action_name in ACTION node should have parentheses at the end, just like a method call. \
The parentheses could be empty if the method takes no argument or could be filled with the \
arguments separated by comma.
4. Be caution that while PRECONDITION have a compound comparison with logical operators `||` and \
`&&`, each CONDITION node can only have ONE binary comparison, which means that CONDITION must NOT have \
logical operator. If you need multiple comparisons, separate them into multiple CONDITION nodes, and \
maybe connect these CONDITION nodes with AND nodes and OR nodes.
5. Comments are used to describe the purpose or function of the sub-tree, but it is not mandatory, thus \
you can freely emit it if you believe it is not necessary.
6. Each node and each binary comparison in PRECONDITION attachment has a Unique ID, i.e. uid. if you \
are adding new nodes or attachments onto an existing tree, you could denote all uid of new added \
as `{ID_PLACEHOLDER}`. Be caution that a new PRECONDITION with more than one binary comparisons have to have \
the same number of `{ID_PLACEHOLDER}`s as the number of binary comparisons.
7. When you are asked to modify an existing tree to meet new requirements:
7.1 you can only make use of the attributes and methods already existed, or provided in the agent \
description. you are not allowed to introduce new actions, methods or attributes.
7.2 When you are trying to modify the tree, you should consider to keep the existing tree structure \
and modify certain parameters and/or comparisons first. If you do have to modify the structure, you \
must follow the rules above strictly during modification.
7.3 If you believe you must break the rules above in order to meet the requirements, you should provide \
the reasons before you modify the tree.
7.4 If you believe you are confuse about or do not 100% understand the logic of the tree clearly, you \
are encouraged to ask questions before you modify the tree.
